					<p>
						At buddies, we strive to build a community that respects the core values of friendship. Buddies will help you celebrate good times and provide support during bad times. We fight isolation and loneliness and give you a chance to offer needed companionship, too.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						An increasing sense of belonging and purpose is one of the most important basics in life. Buddies can communicate with others through our desktop and mobile suite and share stories, but there is more. You can exchange products you donâ€™t need any longer with others. Small local businesses will offer advantages in return for helping them to survive.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						No matter if you are looking for a hug, a chat, visit the cinema, join a party, or maybe even plan your next holiday, you will always find a buddy with the same interest.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Who will be your new buddy?
