					<p>
						To keep the overall contribution as low as possible, buddies will not be promoted through regular media channels. We love to invest in building a better world.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						So how do we grow the buddies community? We grow by sharing our enthusiasm with people we know. If you start doing the same, you will be rewarded.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Every time you share and this leads to a new donation, we say thank you and youâ€™ll receive a small reward. This way you can make a little money on the side. Of course, it would be nice to spend it with one of the affiliated businesses connected to buddies as we fully support our local hard-working business owners to build a bright future as well.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Together we care, together we share.
